            <p>Europe's new data prtection rules will be a reality tomorrow. Europeansâ€™
                privacy will be better protected and companies benefit from a single set
                of rules across the EU. Strong data protection rules are the basis for a
                functioning Digital Single Market and for the online economy to prosper. The
                new rules ensure that citizens can trust in how their data is used and that the
                EU can make best of the opportunities of the data economy.
                Our new data protection rules were agreed for a reason: Two-thirds of
                Europeans are concerned about the way their data was being handled, feeling
                they have no control over information they give online. Companies need clarity
                to be able to safely extend operations across the EU. Recent data scandals
                confirmed that with stricter and clearer data protection rules we are doing the
                right thing in Europe.</p>
